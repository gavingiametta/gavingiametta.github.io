      <h2>Overview</h>
      <body>For this project I created a servo motor that moves based off the change in capacitance whenever an object
        is touching a compacitive sensor. This uses two libraries, the servo library and the capacitive sensor library.
        I have created a schematic below that shows off the project. The capacitive sensor is connected to pins 4(send) and 2(recieve).
        There is also a 1M ohm resistor used to control the distance that the capacicitive sensor can detect an object.
        The servo motor is connected to pin 9 which is used to control the angle of the motor.
